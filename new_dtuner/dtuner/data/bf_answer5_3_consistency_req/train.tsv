Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values .

Spectral centroid physicalattribute SCF is the weighted average frequency for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband . However the center of gravity of a subband is also affected by the harmonic structure and perception frequencies produced by the vocal source particularly for narrow bandwidths .

accurate|<inform> inform ( > )|Spectral centroid physicalattribute SCF is the weighted average frequency for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband . However the center of gravity of a subband is also affected by the harmonic structure and perception frequencies produced by the vocal source particularly for narrow bandwidths . Hence the SCF feature is affected by changes in pitch and harmonic structure .....

Spectral centroid physicalattribute SCF is the weighted average frequency for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband .

Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . Spectral centroid physicalattribute SCM is the weighted average magnitude for a given subband where the weights are the frequency of each magnitude component in that subband . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . SCM captures to a first order approximation the distribution of energy in a subband for two arbitrary signals with the same average energy . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . The different steepness of the weighting function with respect to the subband bandwidth may also be noted this results in different feature element variances .

SCM captures to a first order approximation the distribution of energy in a subband for two arbitrary signals with the same average energy . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . The different steepness of the weighting function with respect to the subband bandwidth may also be noted this results in different feature element variances .

Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . Spectral centroid physicalattribute SCM is the weighted average magnitude for a given subband where the weights are the frequency of each magnitude component in that subband . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . SCM captures to a first order approximation the distribution of energy in a subband for two arbitrary signals with the same average energy .

Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values .

Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . The different steepness of the weighting function with respect to the subband bandwidth may also be noted this results in different feature element variances .

Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband . However the center of gravity of a subband is also affected by the harmonic structure and perception frequencies produced by the vocal source particularly for narrow bandwidths .

Spectral centroid physicalattribute SCF is the weighted average frequency for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband . However the center of gravity of a subband is also affected by the harmonic structure and perception frequencies produced by the vocal source particularly for narrow bandwidths .

Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband .

repetition|<inform> inform ( > )|Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . Spectral centroid physicalattribute SCM is the weighted average magnitude for a given subband where the weights are the frequency of each magnitude component in that subband . SCM captures to a first order approximation the distribution of energy in a subband for two arbitrary signals with the same average energy . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . The different steepness of the weighting function with respect to the subband bandwidth may also be noted this results in different feature element variances .

Spectral centroid physicalattribute SCF is the weighted average frequency for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband . However the center of gravity of a subband is also affected by the harmonic structure and perception frequencies produced by the vocal source particularly for narrow bandwidths .
