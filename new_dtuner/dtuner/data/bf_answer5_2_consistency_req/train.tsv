accurate|<inform> inform ( > )|Spectral centroid physicalattribute SCF is the weighted average frequency for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband . However the center of gravity of a subband is also affected by the harmonic structure and perception frequencies produced by the vocal source particularly for narrow bandwidths .

repetition|<inform> inform ( > )|Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . Spectral centroid physicalattribute SCM is the weighted average magnitude for a given subband where the weights are the frequency of each magnitude component in that subband . SCM captures to a first order approximation the distribution of energy in a subband for two arbitrary signals with the same average energy . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . The different steepness of the weighting function with respect to the subband bandwidth may also be noted this results in different feature element variances . As the spectral centroid magnitude is the magnitude at the position of the spectral centroid frequency it will carry formant related information which is useful for speaker recognition ....

Spectral centroid physicalattribute SCF is the weighted average frequency for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband .

omission|<inform> inform ( > )|SCM captures to a first order approximation the distribution of energy in a subband for two arbitrary signals with the same average energy . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . The different steepness of the weighting function with respect to the subband bandwidth may also be noted this results in different feature element variances . As the spectral centroid magnitude is the magnitude at the position of the spectral centroid frequency it will carry formant related information which is useful for speaker recognition ....

Spectral centroid physicalattribute SCF is the weighted average frequency for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . the audio sample had AudioFeature features extracted and Cepstrum was determined to have a large impact on the FeedforwardNeuralNetwork Abstract that determined the sample to be PhysicalAccess .... Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband . the audio sample had AudioFeature features extracted and Cepstrum was determined to have a large impact on the FeedforwardNeuralNetwork Abstract that determined the sample to be PhysicalAccess .... However the center of gravity of a subband is also affected by the harmonic structure and perception frequencies produced by the vocal source particularly for narrow bandwidths . Hence the SCF feature is affected by changes in pitch and harmonic structure ....

repetition|<inform> inform ( > )|Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . Spectral centroid physicalattribute SCM is the weighted average magnitude for a given subband where the weights are the frequency of each magnitude component in that subband . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . SCM captures to a first order approximation the distribution of energy in a subband for two arbitrary signals with the same average energy . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . The different steepness of the weighting function with respect to the subband bandwidth may also be noted this results in different feature element variances . As the spectral centroid magnitude is the magnitude at the position of the spectral centroid frequency it will carry formant related information which is useful for speaker recognition ....

repetition|<inform> inform ( > )|Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . Spectral centroid physicalattribute SCM is the weighted average magnitude for a given subband where the weights are the frequency of each magnitude component in that subband . SCM captures to a first order approximation the distribution of energy in a subband for two arbitrary signals with the same average energy . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . The different steepness of the weighting function with respect to the subband bandwidth may also be noted this results in different feature element variances .

omission|<inform> inform ( > )|Spectral centroid physicalattribute SCF is the weighted average frequency for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband . However the center of gravity of a subband is also affected by the harmonic structure and perception frequencies produced by the vocal source particularly for narrow bandwidths .

SCM captures to a first order approximation the distribution of energy in a subband for two arbitrary signals with the same average energy . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . The different steepness of the weighting function with respect to the subband bandwidth may also be noted this results in different feature element variances .

Spectral centroid physicalattribute SCF is the weighted average frequency for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband .

omission|<inform> inform ( > )|Spectral centroid physicalattribute SCF is the weighted average frequency for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband . However the center of gravity of a subband is also affected by the harmonic structure and perception frequencies produced by the vocal source particularly for narrow bandwidths .

Spectral centroid physicalattribute SCF is the weighted average frequency for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband . However the center of gravity of a subband is also affected by the harmonic structure and perception frequencies produced by the vocal source particularly for narrow bandwidths .
