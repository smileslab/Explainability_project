hallucination|<inform> inform ( > )|Spectral centroid physical_attribute SCF is the weighted average frequency for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Dynamic microphones were used the most .. Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband . However the center of gravity of a subband is also affected by the harmonic structure and perception frequencies produced by the vocal source particularly for narrow bandwidths . Hence the SCF feature is affected by changes in pitch and harmonic structure ..

Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . SCM captures to a first order approximation the distribution of energy in a subband for two arbitrary signals with the same average energy . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . The different steepness of the weighting function with respect to the subband bandwidth may also be noted this results in different feature element variances .

Spectral centroid physical_attribute SCF is the weighted average frequency for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband .

SCM captures to a first order approximation the distribution of energy in a subband for two arbitrary signals with the same average energy . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . The different steepness of the weighting function with respect to the subband bandwidth may also be noted this results in different feature element variances .

accurate|<inform> inform ( > )|Spectral centroid physical_attribute SCM is the weighted average magnitude for a given subband where the weights are the frequency of each magnitude component in that subband . SCM captures to a first order approximation the distribution of energy in a subband for two arbitrary signals with the same average energy . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . The different steepness of the weighting function with respect to the subband bandwidth may also be noted this results in different feature element variances . As the spectral centroid magnitude is the magnitude at the position of the spectral centroid frequency it will carry formant related information which is useful for speaker recognition ..

repetition|<inform> inform ( > )|Spectral centroid physical_attribute SCM is the weighted average magnitude for a given subband where the weights are the frequency of each magnitude component in that subband . SCM captures to a first order approximation the distribution of energy in a subband for two arbitrary signals with the same average energy . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . The different steepness of the weighting function with respect to the subband bandwidth may also be noted this results in different feature element variances . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . As the spectral centroid magnitude is the magnitude at the position of the spectral centroid frequency it will carry formant related information which is useful for speaker recognition ..

hallucination|<inform> inform ( > )|Dynamic microphones were used the most .. Spectral centroid physical_attribute SCF is the weighted average frequency for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Dynamic microphones were used the most .. Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband . However the center of gravity of a subband is also affected by the harmonic structure and perception frequencies produced by the vocal source particularly for narrow bandwidths . Hence the SCF feature is affected by changes in pitch and harmonic structure ..

repetition|<inform> inform ( > )|Spectral centroid physical_attribute SCM is the weighted average magnitude for a given subband where the weights are the frequency of each magnitude component in that subband . SCM captures to a first order approximation the distribution of energy in a subband for two arbitrary signals with the same average energy . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . The different steepness of the weighting function with respect to the subband bandwidth may also be noted this results in different feature element variances . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . As the spectral centroid magnitude is the magnitude at the position of the spectral centroid frequency it will carry formant related information which is useful for speaker recognition ..

accurate|<inform> inform ( > )|Spectral centroid physical_attribute SCM is the weighted average magnitude for a given subband where the weights are the frequency of each magnitude component in that subband . SCM captures to a first order approximation the distribution of energy in a subband for two arbitrary signals with the same average energy . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . The different steepness of the weighting function with respect to the subband bandwidth may also be noted this results in different feature element variances . As the spectral centroid magnitude is the magnitude at the position of the spectral centroid frequency it will carry formant related information which is useful for speaker recognition ..

Spectral centroid physical_attribute SCF is the weighted average frequency for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband .

SCM captures to a first order approximation the distribution of energy in a subband for two arbitrary signals with the same average energy . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . The different steepness of the weighting function with respect to the subband bandwidth may also be noted this results in different feature element variances . As the spectral centroid magnitude is the magnitude at the position of the spectral centroid frequency it will carry formant related information which is useful for speaker recognition ..

Spectral centroid physical_attribute SCF is the weighted average frequency for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband .

repetition|<inform> inform ( > )|Spectral centroid physical_attribute SCM is the weighted average magnitude for a given subband where the weights are the frequency of each magnitude component in that subband . SCM captures to a first order approximation the distribution of energy in a subband for two arbitrary signals with the same average energy . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . The different steepness of the weighting function with respect to the subband bandwidth may also be noted this results in different feature element variances . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . As the spectral centroid magnitude is the magnitude at the position of the spectral centroid frequency it will carry formant related information which is useful for speaker recognition ..

accurate|<inform> inform ( > )|Spectral centroid physical_attribute SCM is the weighted average magnitude for a given subband where the weights are the frequency of each magnitude component in that subband . SCM captures to a first order approximation the distribution of energy in a subband for two arbitrary signals with the same average energy . Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . The different steepness of the weighting function with respect to the subband bandwidth may also be noted this results in different feature element variances . As the spectral centroid magnitude is the magnitude at the position of the spectral centroid frequency it will carry formant related information which is useful for speaker recognition ..

accurate|<inform> inform ( > )|Spectral centroid physical_attribute SCF is the weighted average frequency for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband . However the center of gravity of a subband is also affected by the harmonic structure and perception frequencies produced by the vocal source particularly for narrow bandwidths . Hence the SCF feature is affected by changes in pitch and harmonic structure ..

hallucination|<inform> inform ( > )|the audio sample had Cepstrum features extracted and StaticMFCC was determined to have a large impact on the Feedforward_Neural_Network Representation that determined the sample to be PhysicalAccess .. Spectral centroid physical_attribute SCM is the weighted average magnitude for a given subband where the weights are the frequency of each magnitude component in that subband . SCM captures to a first order approximation the distribution of energy in a subband for two arbitrary signals with the same average energy . the audio sample had Cepstrum features extracted and StaticMFCC was determined to have a large impact on the Feedforward_Neural_Network Representation that determined the sample to be PhysicalAccess .. Due to the weighting function the two signals would each be represented by different SCF and SCM values . The different steepness of the weighting function with respect to the subband bandwidth may also be noted this results in different feature element variances . the audio sample had Cepstrum features extracted and StaticMFCC was determined to have a large impact on the Feedforward_Neural_Network Representation that determined the sample to be PhysicalAccess .. As the spectral centroid magnitude is the magnitude at the position of the spectral centroid frequency it will carry formant related information which is useful for speaker recognition ..
