      "Spectral centroid physicalattribute SCF is the weighted average frequency for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband . However the center of gravity of a subband is also affected by the harmonic structure and perception frequencies produced by the vocal source particularly for narrow bandwidths . Hence the SCF feature is affected by changes in pitch and harmonic structure ..."
