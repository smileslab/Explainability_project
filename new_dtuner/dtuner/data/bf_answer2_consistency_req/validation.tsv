Hence , the SCF feature is affected by changes in pitch and harmonic structure . Spectral centroid frequency ( SCF ) is the weighted average frequency for a given subband , where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband, it can detect the approximate location of formants, which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband .

Spectral centroid frequency ( SCF ) is the weighted average frequency for a given subband , where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband, it can detect the approximate location of formants, which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband .

Hence , the SCF feature is affected by changes in pitch and harmonic structure . Hence , the SCF feature is affected by changes in pitch and harmonic structure . Spectral centroid frequency ( SCF ) is the weighted average frequency for a given subband , where the weights are the normalized energy of each frequency component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband, it can detect the approximate location of formants, which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband .
