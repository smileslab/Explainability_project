The linear modeling of speech generation serves as the actual basis for the generation of MFCCs A periodic excitation signal vocal cords is formed by a linear SoftwareAgent mouth tongue nasal cavities ... . The SoftwareAgent or its impulse response is primarily important for speech recognition since what was said and not in which perception is of interest for the analysis ....."
