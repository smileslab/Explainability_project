Spectral centroid Physicalquantities SCF is the weighted average Physicalquantities for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each Physicalquantities component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband . However the center of gravity of a subband is also affected by the harmonic structure and perception frequencies produced by the vocal source particularly for narrow bandwidths . Hence the SCF feature is affected by changes in perception and harmonic structure ......

omission|<inform> inform ( > )|Spectral centroid Physicalquantities SCF is the weighted average Physicalquantities for a given subband where the weights are the normalized energy of each Physicalquantities component in that subband . Since this measure captures the center of gravity of each subband it can detect the approximate location of formants which are manifested as peaks in neighbouring subband . However the center of gravity of a subband is also affected by the harmonic structure and perception frequencies produced by the vocal source particularly for narrow bandwidths .
